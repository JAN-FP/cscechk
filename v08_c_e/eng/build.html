            As a leader in the construction industry, CSHK constructs the bones of cities with reinforced concrete while nurturing the soul of communities with humanistic care. CSHK is redefining modern construction with “technology + warmth,” from sharing green building experiences to innovative practices at demonstration sites. We believe that the essence of a city’s iconic status lies not in its height, but in the bustling footsteps of corporate executives strolling along the newly developed waterfront promenade in Central, the backdrop of people enjoying a stroll next to the flood barrier, the smiles of seniors recuperating in healthcare facilities, and the comforting glow of nightly lights as individuals return home safely. The sincerity in “Constructing Buildings and Cities, Yet More Significantly, Cultivating Hearts” serves as a heartfelt declaration of love to Hong Kong.

            The Central Harbour front IL9088 Development Project (Site 3A) represents the culmination of the Central District Reclamation Project in Hong Kong, situated at the nucleus of Hong Kong’s political and economic hub, close to key institutions such as the Central Government Offices, the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Serving as the first major large-scale project spearheaded by a Chinese-funded contractor along the Central Harbour front, the project’s completion not only reshapes the skyline of Hong Kong but also signifies a groundbreaking involvement of a Chinese-funded enterprise in this renowned area. With its design concept centered around a “bridge,” this project aims to fashion a world-renowned landmark, fostering stronger links between Central’s inner city and waterfront while offering extensive greenery and public spaces to foster community vitality and sustainable growth.

            Located in the Northern Metropolis of Hong Kong, the Yuen Long Barrage Scheme is “first large-scale dam initiative in Hong Kong” (designed to meet a 200-year flood prevention standard) launched by the Hong Kong Drainage Services Department. This project represents a strategic response to to the challenges posed by global climate change and the frequent occurrence of extreme weather events. Leveraging advanced technology, the project team has integrated the concept of “active adaptation to climate change” across the entire design, construction, and operational phases. Upon its completion, the project is expected to significantly reduce local flood risks, enhance the hydrological environment, and bring benefits to hundreds of thousands of residents. It aligns with the Hong Kong government’s vision of creating a “riverside city”, fostering a stronger ecological link between the back-bay and the Yuen Long Nullah and providing resilient and robust flood protection measures.

            The Redevelopment project of Our Lady of Maryknoll Hospital, constructed by CSHK, is a key project of the Hong Kong government's "Ten-Year Hospital Development Plan", aiming to address the medical challenges brought about by an aging population. This hospital, which has served the Wong Tai Sin District for over 60 years, will significantly enhance its daytime medical service capacity after reconstruction and is expected to reduce the waiting time by 50%. The project not only continues the hospital's tradition of community health education, but also enhances services such as vaccination and health check-ups for the elderly through modern facilities. CSHK will apply advanced construction technologies to create a better medical environment for Hong Kong citizens, fulfill the development vision of "Healthy Hong Kong", and demonstrate the company's social responsibility in public welfare projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            In response to the visions of “Healthy China” and “Healthy Hong Kong” and to address the issue of strained medical resources caused by an aging population, the Hong Kong government launched the “Ten-year Hospital Development Plan” in 2016, of which the Redevelopment of Our Lady of Maryknoll Hospital, constructed by CSHK, is a significant component of this strategy. Our Lady of Maryknoll Hospital has served the Wong Tai Sin District for over 60 years, during which it has actively promoted health education and preventive services in the community, such as health check-ups for the elderly and vaccination services. However, the old buildings cannot be expanded, posing challenges for the medical facilities to adequately meet the rising service demands. The redevelopment will enable the hospital to improve its daytime medical services, with the aim of halving waiting times to meet the needs of local residents. CSHK will further utilize its cutting-edge construction technologies to help address Hong Kong citizens urgent demand for quality medical services.

We have established a 24-hour real-time monitoring system (including subsidence, vibration, noise, and air quality) and implemented video surveillance to ensure that the impact on the community is minimized. We also communicate with regional representatives from time to time.

            The Redevelopment of Our Lady of Maryknoll Hospital is centered on the concept of “Community Family”. Through in-person illustrations, the assistance of traffic supervisors, and the coordination of work processes according to the school calendar, a warm network of community care is woven. The project integrates BIM technology, modular construction and C-SMART Platform, and strictly follows international medical standards. The use of GGBS concrete in the construction process reduced carbon emissions by 14,621 tonnes, and the successful transplantation of over-40-year-old phoenix trees was awarded with dual green certification, realizing the triple vision of “healing architecture, ecological sustainability, community symbiosis”.
